# Java Blockchain

A simple implementation of a blockchain in Java.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in the Java programming language. It demonstrates the basic concepts of a blockchain, including adding blocks, calculating block hashes, and mining them.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in a Java development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Run the `JavaBlockchainApplication` class from the main package to start the application.

## How It Works

1. Upon starting the application, a blockchain is created with a specified prefix for mining difficulty.
2. Several blocks are added to the blockchain using the `addBlock()` method from the `Blockchain` class.
3. For each added block, the block hash is calculated and mining is attempted until a valid hash is found.
4. Details about each block in the blockchain are displayed in the console, including the previous hash, block data, timestamp, and block hash.
